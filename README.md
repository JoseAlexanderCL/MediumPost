The dataset contains information of Customers Default Payments in Taiwan. It has demographic variables like gender, level education, age, and payment behaviour variables like delay in payments, bill amounts and default (yes or no).


# Motivation

The main motivation behind this project is to apply exploratory data analysis techniques with Python over a finance focused application (Default Analysis).

# Results
With the Jupyter Notebook and the blogpost I show how relevant is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to answer common business questions. In particular I answered the next questions:
- Does men have higher default rates compared to women? 

- The default rates are lower for customers with higher level of education?

- The delays in payments from previous months are related to default over next menth?
